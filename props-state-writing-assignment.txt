Both props and changes in state trigger an update with regard to rendering a component.  Props (or properties) allow components to communicate with one another.  Parent components use them to pass information down to child components.  They are similar to passing arguments to a function and cannot be changed (immutable or read only).  The state of a component refers to the tracking of information between the time that a component is rendered, and then updated.  Unlike props, the state of a component can be changed.
